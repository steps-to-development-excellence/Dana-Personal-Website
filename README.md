# Dana-Personal-Website

This is my professional personal website. I have created this site to give folk a view into my journey to becoming a fullstack developer. This journey will take me the next six months to complete, and I will be updating this repo as I go. Please comeback and check in a few months to see how much I have grown as a develper.
